# Python Base Extension

‚ùó This is a legacy release. This version won't be updated.

Please update to [`PyBackport`](https://github.com/Jtachan/PyBackport) to continue using a maintained version.
`pybase-ext` will be deprecated when `py-backport` has its major release v1.0.

## About

_Python Base Extension_ main goal is to backport functionalities from newer python releases.
It allows using its modules just as the original ones, with the only difference at the import.

Any backported (or experimental) functionality can be imported with the module `pybase_ext`.

```python
from pybase_ext import enum


class Number(enum.IntEnum):
    """Enumeration using the original 'IntEnum' call"""
    ONE = enum.auto()
    TWO = 2


class Animal(enum.StrEnum):
    """Supported original 'StrEnum' for python versions < 3.11"""
    CAT = enum.auto()
    DOG = "dog"


class Color(enum.TupleEnum):
    """Experimental 'TupleEnum' class"""
    BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
    WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
```
